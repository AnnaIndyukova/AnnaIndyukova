## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over 10 years of experience in software development within the fintech and accounting sectors (utilizing technologies such as 1C and PL/SQL), I have successfully transitioned to web development. 

I am now focused on creating full-stack applications, using React and TypeScript for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend.
